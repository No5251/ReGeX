ReGeX is a Android game that's all about ["Regular Expressions"][regex].
In different modes the user can try to solve tasks, which range from
having to match only ceratin strings but not others, or extracting
parts of a string with a regular expression, making it enjoyable (under
a certain definition of pleasure) for beginners and people with more
experience alike.

More information can be found on the [project homepage][website],
the app can be downloaded from [F-Droid][fdroid], and most of the
development (including issues and suggestions) is to be found on
[GitHub][github]. ReGeX is published under [GPL v3][license].
